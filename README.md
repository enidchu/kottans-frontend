## Stage 0. Self-Study

### General

### 0. [Git Basics](tasks/git-intro.md) <br>
My impressons of learning Git:

First of all, I would like to appreciate [learngitbranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) this website. It's very easy-using and including comprehensive knowledge of Git.

For the process of learning Git, the Rebase part confused me the most. 
Besides practicing the test developed by the website, I also searched informaion online got to know more clear about this concept.

Another thing is it took me more time to learn this tool as I estimated. 
I thought I could complete all the levels within 2 days, it turned out took me about 3 days to finish them.

Action is better than words, so I tried my 1st pull-request to get more familiar with this tool!

###  1. [Linux CLI and Networking](tasks/linux-cli-http.md)
My impression of learning Linux CLI and Networking:

I would like to appreciate [Linux Survival](https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-man-command-exercise/) first. It makes the knowleadge of Linux super easy-understanding! The way it explains about every Linux command is very clear. It also comes very practical quiz when each topic ends. 
I recommend this tutorial from bottom of my heart, it's very friendly for people who want to learn Linux even you don't have idea what it is!

<br>
#### On the other hand, HTTP Networking is a quite abstract topic while learning. <br>
Followings articles are the materials that course want us to read :
1. [HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 1](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177)
2. [HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 2](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-2--net-31155) <br>

It left me in a messed world while understanding. I read the above articles over and over again, also researched the mandarin materails additionally. After reading lots of papers, I concluded:
#### The knowledge of HTTP is very extensive, and my tour of HTTP began is just begun. With the basic foundation of URL schemes, status codes and request/response headers. Then building up with the finer areas, such as connection handling, identification and authentication and caching. 
#### The familiarity of HTTP relies on experiences. The situations are case-by-case, people get more familiar with it when fixing the problems.

Finally completed my Stage 0 courses after having Git collaboration class! This course guides you the overall concept and flow of using remote repositories to work with other developers. The lessons are very detailed-written, so it took me few days to finish and pracite the whole content. It also provides addtional materials for referrence, quite useful! Hope I can get better at Git the more I do it.
